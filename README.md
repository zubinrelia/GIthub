# 1. Customer segmentation using dimensional reduction and clustering.
### • Project Description
The problem statement for customer segmentation involves identifying distinct customer segments based on their demographic, behavioural, and psychographic characteristics, and developing targeted marketing strategies that resonate with each segment. The goal is to better understand the needs and preferences of different customer groups, and to develop marketing strategies that increase customer engagement and loyalty.
Clustering techniques are used to group customers based on their similarities and differences in terms of their behaviours, preferences, and characteristics. The objective is to identify groups of customers who share similar needs and behaviours, and to develop targeted marketing strategies that are tailored to each group. The end goal is to increase customer satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability by providing personalized products, services, and experiences that resonate with each customer segment.
### •	Usage
Once the clusters are generated, they need to be interpreted in the context of the business problem. This involves understanding the characteristics of each cluster and identifying the key differences between them. Based on the insights gained from customer segmentation, develop targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment. This may involve designing personalized products, services, and experiences that resonate with each segment. Once the marketing strategies are developed, they need to be implemented and monitored to ensure that they are effective in achieving the desired business outcomes. This involves tracking customer behaviour and feedback, adjusting as needed, and continuously improving the clustering.
# 2. IPL boundary hitting impact and pattern analysis.
### •	Project Description
This project aimed to analyse and gain insights from IPL (Indian Premier League) match data. The dataset consisted of detailed information about matches, teams, players, and their performances. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we explored various aspects of the IPL, including team performance, player statistics, and boundary-hitting abilities. Comparative analysis and feature engineering was conducted to identify top-performing teams and players based on their boundary-hitting abilities. Lastly data visualization techniques were utilized to present the findings in an intuitive and engaging manner.
Through this project, we gained valuable insights into the dynamics of the IPL, including the impact of boundaries on team and player performances. The findings can be useful for team management, player selection, and strategic decision-making in future IPL seasons.
### •	Usage
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of team and player performances in the IPL. It enables stakeholders such as team management, coaches, and analysts to assess the boundary-hitting abilities of teams and players, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve performance. The insights gained from the project can also be used to develop effective team strategies. Understanding the distribution of boundaries across different game phases (powerplay, middle overs, death overs) helps teams optimize their batting approach, identify areas for improvement, and plan their innings accordingly. Lastly the analysis and visualizations generated by this project can be shared with IPL fans, media, and cricket enthusiasts. It enhances the fan experience by providing meaningful insights, highlighting exciting moments, and fostering discussions around team and player performances.
